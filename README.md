# qodot-entities
A collection of Qodot based entities to add to your FGD for use with Trenchbroom and Godot. These files aren't quite drag'n'drop / plug'n'play ready: for the GDNative versions you'll need to compile them as part of a GDNative plugin for your project and create the necessary GDNS files for them. The GDScript versions can be dropped in without too much trouble but you'll need to make sure your scenes and Qodot FGD entity resources point to the right scripts or packed scenes. Think of these more as examples of what you can do with Godot, Qodot, and Trenchbroom, and how you might do it for your own projects.

All entities on here are provided as is, with no guarantees of functionality within your own projects nor any guarantees of instruction or troubleshooting.

All entities provided under Creative Commons Zero where applicable, except where restricted by the Godot, Qodot, or Trenchbroom licenses.
